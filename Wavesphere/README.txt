This is the Wavesphere embedded application master project.

Some rules for committing:
1. Do not commit the debug folder. This is important. Don't do it.
2. Never commit a project that does not build. Never. Ever.
3. The project does not have to be fully working for it to be commited. But please MAKE SURE IT BUILDS.

Some rules for editing:
1. The author is the user who created the file. It is not all of those who contribute on it. There should be only one
	author per file.
2. Use tabs for indenting. DO NOT USE SPACES.
3. Do not allow a line to go over 120 columns in length.
4. Remove all trailing whitespace.
